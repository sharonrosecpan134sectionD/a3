This project implements a simple interactive quiz using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The quiz provides immediate feedback to users on their answers and displays a final score upon completion. It also includes a "fake" authentication system using JavaScript variables to start the quiz.

Implementation Details
HTML Structure
The HTML structure defines the quiz interface using semantic elements. It includes a form for quiz questions and answer options, a feedback area for displaying correctness, and a final score section.

CSS Styling
CSS styles provide a clean and user-friendly interface for the quiz. It ensures consistent styling, including visual feedback for correct and incorrect answers through color changes and button hover effects.

JavaScript Logic
JavaScript handles the interactive aspects of the quiz:

Question Display: Displays each quiz question and its options dynamically.
Answer Checking: Validates user selections against the correct answers and provides immediate feedback.
Score Tallying: Keeps track of the user's score as they progress through the quiz.
Fake Authentication: Simulates a basic authentication system to prompt users to start the quiz with a username.
Challenges Faced
Dynamic Content Updates: Ensuring smooth transitions between quiz questions and updating content dynamically without page refreshes was a challenge. This was addressed by manipulating DOM elements effectively in JavaScript.

Error Handling: Implementing robust error handling for edge cases such as when users forget to select an answer or when inputs are incorrect required careful consideration to maintain user flow and experience.

Responsive Design: Ensuring the quiz interface remains responsive across different devices and screen sizes posed challenges in terms of layout adjustments and CSS media queries.

Accessibility: Enhancing accessibility features, such as keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility, required additional testing and adjustments to HTML structure and CSS styles.

Future Improvements
Enhanced Feedback: Implement more detailed feedback, such as explanations for correct answers or additional hints for incorrect ones.

More Interactive Elements: Introduce interactive elements like timers, hints, or animations to further engage users during the quiz.

Leaderboard or Results Sharing: Include features to share quiz results or compare scores with other users for a competitive aspect.
